# Credit_loan_model
This project aims to build a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict the risk of lending a loan to an applicant based on various socio-economic and financial indicators. It helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions and minimize credit risk.

Project Objective

To develop a predictive model that classifies whether a loan applicant is risky or not risky, leveraging key attributes such as:

  - Applicant's income
  - Employment status
  - Previous loans
  - Job type
  - Housing and marital status
  - Credit history, and more
Goal: Classify loan applications as risky or safe.

Model Used:
  - XGBoost Classifier

Pipeline Steps:
  - Data cleaning and feature engineering
  - Label encoding and one-hot encoding
  - Train-test split and scaling
  - XGBoost model training and hyperparameter tuning
  - Evaluation and visualization

Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve

Key Highlights
  - Use of XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm for tabular data.
  - Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline to handle categorical and numerical features.
  - Clear evaluation using multiple classification metrics and visual tools.
  - Model interpretability using feature importance.
